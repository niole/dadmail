# Install

## dependencies
- expo
- npm

```sh
npm install -g eas-cli
npm i
```


# Dev Mode
This app uses expo development builds because it uses the google oath API for react native x android

## create new dev build
why? bc you installed new react-native code and you want to use it in dev mode.

```sh
npm run dev-build

# then scan the QR code with your mobile device's camera
# don't use an emulator
# follow the instructions in the UI
```

## run app
```sh
npm run start-dev-client
```
